How to use icecream

You need:

One machine that runs the scheduler ("./icecc-scheduler -d")
Many machines that run the daemon ("./iceccd -d")
It is possible to run the scheduler and the daemon on one machine and only the daemon on another, thus forming a compile cluster with two nodes.

If you want to compile using icecream, make sure $prefix/lib/icecc/bin is the first entry in your path, e.g. type

 export PATH=/usr/lib/icecc/bin:$PATH
(Hint: put this in ~/.bashrc or /etc/profile to not have to type it in everytime)

Then you just compile with make -j <nu
